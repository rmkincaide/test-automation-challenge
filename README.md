# test-automation-challenge
Prerequisites to execute the tests:

Chrome (I used version 61.0.3163.100 64-bit, which was the latest at the time of development)
MS Visual Studio (I used 2015 Enterprise, but solution should be compatible with other versions)
You'll need a way to execute NUnit 3 tests (I use Resharper Ultimate but I believe you can also get NUnit Console for free from https://github.com/nunit/nunit-console/releases/tag/3.7 )

After opening the solution and building, NuGet should pull the proper Selenium & SpecFlow packages after doing a Rebuild All

Sample output logs and screenshots from 11/2 and 11/4 can be found here: https://github.com/rmkincaide/test-automation-challenge/tree/master/examples

Thanks for viewing!
